# Machine Learning Regression Code

This repository contains a collection of code for implementing various regression models in machine learning. Regression models are used to predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or more input variables.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can then clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Machine-Learning.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can install the required Python packages by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The code in this repository is organized into different files for different regression models. Each file contains a Python class that implements the model and provides methods for fitting the model to data, making predictions, and evaluating the performance of the model.

To use a particular regression model, you can create an instance of the corresponding Python class and call its methods. For example, to use linear regression, you can do the following:

```python
from linear_regression import LinearRegression

# create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# fit the model to data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# make predictions on new data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# evaluate the performance of the model
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
```

## Available Models

The following regression models are currently available in this repository:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- ElasticNet Regression
